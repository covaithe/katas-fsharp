## Greg's katas in F#

This repo is to store various kata implementations in F#.

This branch is the starting point for working on the word search kata from here:
https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-word-search

It has a failing acceptance test.

To run the tests, do this:

```
dotnet test
```

or, if you prefer to run the tests continuously:

```
dotnet watch test --project WordSearch.Tests
```

### Plans

It's been a while, so I just want to see if I remember vaguely how to do this.

### Reflections

Well, I do remember how to do this, pretty vaguely. Some experimentation was required.
Ionide has updated and includes an F# linter by default now, which is a bit annoying, but
did teach me about the existence of Seq.collect, which I do like.

I still do sort of like this kata, and I'd like to get it polished to the point where I
could record an implementation.
