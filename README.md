## Greg's katas in F#

This repo is to store various kata implementations in F#.

This branch is the starting point for working on the word search kata from here:
https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-word-search

It has a failing acceptance test.

To run the tests, do this:

```
dotnet test
```

or, if you prefer to run the tests continuously:

```
dotnet watch test --project WordSearch.Tests
```

### Plans


I've been having trouble finding time to practice this. Again. So this run will
likely be mostly maintenance / remembering. I still feel like the crux of this
kata is the refactoring to prepare for adding directions. That's where I usually
have to stop and think. Also I wish I were better at remembering the natural order
to write the tests in.

### Reflections

It went surprisingly well. I managed to get an uninterrupted hour and the implementation
went pretty smoothly. I did the tests in an order I'm happy with, without much trouble
coming up with the next test. Even the refactor to prepare directions went okay, though
I think there's still room for improvement there.

Still, if I had managed to record this session, with commentary, I'd be pleased with that.
