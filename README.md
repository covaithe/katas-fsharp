## Greg's katas in F#

This repo is to store various kata implementations in F#.

This branch is the starting point for working on the word search kata from here:
https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-word-search

It has a failing acceptance test.

To run the tests, do this:

```
dotnet test
```

or, if you prefer to run the tests continuously:

```
dotnet watch test --project WordSearch.Tests
```

### Plans

First attempt at recording! Let's see how this goes.

### Reflections

After watching the recording, here are some thoughts.
* Not bad! I don't think this needs much editing.
* I should probably turn gitlens off for this. It did lots of popups.
* I didn't really explain partial function invocation
* or pipelines, or calling a function vs. piping to it. This is kind of basic F# stuff, and this isn't really an intro to F# video, but still, it could maybe use an explanation.
* When I'm reacting to text in the test output, I should try to read out loud the text I'm reacting to. Don't assume people are reading along with me, or at my reading pace.
