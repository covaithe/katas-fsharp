## Greg's katas in F#

This repo is to store various kata implementations in F#.

This branch is the starting point for working on the word search kata from here:
https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-word-search

It has a failing acceptance test.

To run the tests, do this:

```
dotnet test
```

or, if you prefer to run the tests continuously:

```
dotnet watch test --project WordSearch.Tests
```

### Plans

It's been a while since my last go through of this kata, but I remember it went pretty well.
I'm going to do it straight through this time, schedule myself another practice this week,
and try to record it next weekend.

### Reflections

Kata itself went smooth-ish. I forgot a few F# syntax bits and had to do some trial and error, but
I didn't fumble for long. I tried to talk my way through the solution as I went, and that was
less than ideal. Need some work there. I think it would be okay, but I think I can do better with practice.
