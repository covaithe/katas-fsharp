## Greg's katas in F#

This repo is to store various kata implementations in F#.

This branch is the starting point for working on the word search kata from here:
https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-word-search

It has a failing acceptance test.

To run the tests, do this:

```
dotnet test
```

or, if you prefer to run the tests continuously:

```
dotnet watch test --project WordSearch.Tests
```

### Plans

Not sure of specific plans. Maybe look into some snippets to facilitate easier test writing / assertions?

### Reflections

building the snippets was gratifyingly easy and quick in VS code. I need to do that more.

Kata was pretty decent. At the step of adding directions, I tried to refactor to make it smoother rather than just adding them in a sorta-big step. That was harder but I think it's worth doing more. I got interrupted halfway, which didn't help.

Another thing I think would help me be smoother is learning more navigation commands for VS code, like being able to move between splits more easily.
