## Greg's katas in F#

This repo is to store various kata implementations in F#.

This branch is the starting point for working on the word search kata from here:
https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-word-search

It has a failing acceptance test.

To run the tests, do this:

```
dotnet test
```

or, if you prefer to run the tests continuously:

```
dotnet watch test --project WordSearch.Tests
```

### Plans

Trying to focus on only taking the steps necessary to pass each test, and writing tests that will only drive the smallest next bit of functionality.

### Reflections

I didn't finish this one. Got distracted and let it sit for over a month, and I have no idea what's going on now. Gonna start over.
