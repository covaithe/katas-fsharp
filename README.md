## Greg's katas in F#

This repo is to store various kata implementations in F#.

This branch is the starting point for working on the word search kata from here:
https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-word-search

It has a failing acceptance test.

To run the tests, do this:

```
dotnet test
```

or, if you prefer to run the tests continuously:

```
dotnet watch test --project WordSearch.Tests
```
