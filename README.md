## Greg's katas in F#

This repo is to store various kata implementations in F#.

This branch is the starting point for working on the word search kata from here:
https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-word-search

It has a failing acceptance test.

To run the tests, do this:

```
dotnet test
```

or, if you prefer to run the tests continuously:

```
dotnet watch test --project WordSearch.Tests
```

### Plans

It's been a few weeks since I wrote any F#. Let's see if I remember any of it.

### Reflections

Got through in one day (had a slow day of meetings and such) which is better than
I've done before I think. I didn't have to look anything up, though it did take me
a moment to remember how to do a few things.

I like the names I came up with during this run. I think they do a better job
describing the algorithm than I usually manage.
