== Greg's katas in F# ==

This repo is to store various kata implementations in F#. 
I'm pretty new to it (as of early 2021) but have some experience
with functional programming in other languages, so we'll see
how this goes. 

Most of the actual implementations live on branches, which won't
ever be merged into main.
