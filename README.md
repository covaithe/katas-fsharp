## Greg's katas in F#

This repo is to store various kata implementations in F#.

This branch is the starting point for working on the word search kata from here:
https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-word-search

It has a failing acceptance test.

To run the tests, do this:

```
dotnet test
```

or, if you prefer to run the tests continuously:

```
dotnet watch test --project WordSearch.Tests
```

### Plans

Not sure. Haven't done this in a while, and my last reflections didn't have much to go on.

I had the thought of maybe recording this kata to put up somewhere recently. Maybe I'll just work on polishing it.

### Reflections

I felt a little rusty doing this. Had to stop and fix mistakes a few times. On the other hand,
there are parts of this kata where I feel like I'm typing from memory rather than actually
figuring it out as I go, so maybe it's good to have to slow down and figure it out.

I do think I want to be wary of just typing several lines of finished code just because
I've done it before and know about what the answer is. Part of the point of katas is that you
don't have to struggle working out the answer, just taking the next step, but the temptation to take
bigger steps than the tests warrant can be strong. Something to watch out for.
